Do you have a website? Or a mobile app? If you do, you must ensure that your webpages are accessible to all users, including those who use a keyboard to navigate. Keyboard accessibility is an important aspect of web accessibility as it helps to provide an equal user experience for everyone, regardless of their ability.

In this blog post, we will discuss what keyboard accessibility is, why it is important, how to test for it, and the tools you can use to make sure your website is keyboard-friendly. We will also look at some examples of keyboard accessibility, as well as tips and tricks to make the process easier. So, let’s get started!

## What is keyboard accessibility?
Keyboard accessibility is the ability of a website or application to be navigable using only a keyboard. This means that users who cannot use a mouse or other pointing device can still use the website or application.

In order for a website or application to be keyboard accessible, it needs to have certain features in place. These include being able to tab between elements, being able to use the arrow keys to move through the page, and being able to use shortcut keys to access certain elements.

The goal of keyboard accessibility is to make sure that everyone has the same experience when using a website or application, regardless of their physical ability.

## Why is keyboard accessibility important?
Keyboard accessibility is important for a number of reasons.

First, it ensures that all users can navigate a website or application, regardless of their physical ability. This is especially important for people who are unable to use a mouse or other pointing device.

Second, keyboard accessibility helps people with disabilities access information more easily. This can be especially helpful for people with motor impairments, such as those with cerebral palsy, as they may find it difficult to use a mouse or other pointing device.

Third, keyboard accessibility helps to improve the overall user experience. By making it easier for people to navigate a website or application, they are more likely to stay on the page longer and explore more of the content. This ultimately leads to better engagement and more conversions.

Finally, keyboard accessibility is important for search engine optimization. Search engines tend to rank websites with better accessibility higher in their results. This means that having a keyboard-accessible website can help you to get more traffic and, ultimately, more conversions.

## How to test for keyboard accessibility?
Testing for keyboard accessibility is not as difficult as you may think. There are a number of tools available to help you assess your website or application for keyboard accessibility.

The most popular tool is the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool. This tool provides an easy-to-understand report that highlights any issues with your website or application’s keyboard accessibility.

Other tools include the Keyboard Accessibility Checker, the Total Validator, and the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) Checker. These tools are more advanced and provide more detailed reports, but they may be more difficult to use.

The best way to test for keyboard accessibility is to actually use the website or application with only a keyboard. This will give you a better understanding of how a user would experience your website or application with a keyboard.

## Benefits of keyboard accessibility
Making sure your website or application is keyboard accessible can have a number of benefits.

First, it can help to improve the overall user experience. By making it easier for people to navigate your website or application, they are more likely to stay on the page longer and explore more of the content. This ultimately leads to better engagement and more conversions.

Second, it can help to improve search engine rankings. As mentioned previously, search engines tend to rank websites with better accessibility higher in their results. This means that having a keyboard-accessible website can help you to get more traffic and, ultimately, more conversions.

Third, it can help to make sure that all users, regardless of their physical ability, can access your website or application. This can be especially helpful for people with disabilities, as navigating a website or application with a keyboard can be much easier than using a mouse or other pointing device.

Finally, it can help to increase your website’s compliance with accessibility standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This can help to ensure that all users, regardless of their ability, can access the content on your website or application.

## Examples of keyboard accessibility
There are a number of features that are necessary for a website or application to be keyboard accessible.

The first feature is the ability to tab between elements. This means that users can easily move through the page without having to use a mouse or other pointing device.

The second feature is the ability to use the arrow keys to move through the page. This allows users to easily move up, down, left, and right without having to use a mouse or other pointing device.

The third feature is the ability to use shortcut keys to access certain elements. This makes it easier for users to access certain elements without having to use a mouse or other pointing device.
