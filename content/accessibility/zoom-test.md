## What is a Zoom Test?
A Zoom Test is a type of website accessibility assessment. It is a process of analyzing a website to ensure that it meets the standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This process is based on the principles of web accessibility and involves a wide range of tests, from basic HTML and CSS validation to more advanced tests such as color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

The main goal of a Zoom Test is to ensure that a website is accessible to all users, regardless of their disability. It is important to note that a Zoom Test is not a replacement for an automated accessibility audit, but it is a powerful tool for manual QA testing.

## Benefits of Zoom Testing
A Zoom Test provides a number of benefits to businesses. First, it can help identify potential accessibility issues and ensure that a website is compliant with the W3C standards. Second, it can help identify usability and design issues, such as confusing navigation or low-contrast colors. Third, it can help ensure that a website is optimized for all devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop. Finally, a Zoom Test can help improve the overall user experience, as it helps ensure that all users are able to access and use a website without any difficulty.

## What to Look for in a Website During a Zoom Test
When conducting a Zoom Test, there are a few key aspects to look for. The first is HTML validation. This involves checking the HTML code of a website to ensure that it complies with the W3C standards. The second is color contrast. This involves checking the contrast between the background and foreground colors of a website to ensure that it is easy to read and understand. The third is keyboard navigation. This involves ensuring that a website can be navigated using only a keyboard, as some users may not be able to use a mouse. Finally, the fourth is screen reader compatibility. This involves ensuring that a website can be read aloud by screen reader software, as some users may be visually impaired.

## The 8 Steps of a Zoom Test
A Zoom Test can be broken down into 8 steps:

1. Identify the purpose of the website.
2. Analyze the website’s HTML code to ensure that it complies with the W3C standards.
3. Verify the color contrast between the background and foreground colors of the website.
4. Test the website’s navigation using only a keyboard.
5. Test the website’s compatibility with screen reader software.
6. Test the website’s responsiveness on different devices, such as mobile, tablet, and desktop.
7. Test the website’s performance, such as page loading speed and server response time.
8. Provide feedback and recommendations to improve website accessibility.

When conducting a Zoom Test, it is important to keep the following tips in mind:
